           <h3>Wrapping up 2023</h3>
           <p>The most unexpected thing happened to me this year: I'm able to spend the rest of my 2023 with you, not just as a friend but also as a lover. As we wrap up this year, we've created so many memories together.</p>

                <h3>what makes our love special?</h3>
                <p>I love how we gradually transitioned from being friends to lovers. We began as classmates, casually talking and teasing each other on TikTok, until we became incredibly close. Initially, I didn't know much about you, but over the months of our conversations, you learned about my entire life. I found myself developing feelings for you, but uncertainty lingered, and it felt like my affection might be unrequited. However, everything changed when I mustered the courage to ask you a hypothetical question about us being romantically involved. To my joy, it turned out to be requited. That day became the best day of my life! Look at us now.</p>

         <h1 class="heading"> Riri's Favorite <span>Memories</span> </h1>
         <p class="opening">We've shared countless memories and had numerous dates; there are so many that I can't even count or list them all because each one was filled with joy and greatness. Whenever I'm with you, it feels as if a weight has been lifted from my chest, and I'm eternally grateful for the wonderful moments we've created together. I'll carry those memories with me forever, and please know that, in order to preserve them, I'll continue to live—for you.</p>

                 <p>One of the most cherished memories etched in my heart is our initial encounter when I delicately clasped your hand. I remember vividly the tremor in your grasp, and I found it utterly endearing, even though I wasn't in the best condition that day. My concern was not to burden you with my worries, and yet, a persistent fear lingered—what if you realized that you didn't truly fancy me after that day? Another memory surfaces when I embraced you, and you didn't appear entirely at ease. I comprehended your hesitation, and it's astounding to witness the remarkable transformation since that moment. Presently, you exude affection and embrace a clinginess that warms my heart. That bus ride remains ensconced as the most enchanting experience; every second felt like I was soaring on cloud nine. Even now, it retains the ethereal quality of a beautiful dream, a dream that continues to captivate my senses.</p>

                 <p>From the moment we crossed paths, I never fathomed that we would experience the magic of sharing a kiss. That initial embrace of our lips marked the pinnacle of enchantment in my life. The tenderness of your lips, redolent with the fragrance of a gentle breeze, left an indelible impression. Your scent was so captivating, and the proximity of our beings was surreal—I could hear the rhythmic cadence of your breath and sense the reverberations of your heartbeat. The kiss we exchanged was not merely a meeting of lips; it was an exchange imbued with love, devoid of any hint of confusion, fear, or regret. It was a moment of absolute purity, a poignant reminder of the vitality that had been absent from my life for countless years. For the very first time, I experienced a profound sense of aliveness, a profound connection with you that breathed new meaning into my existence. It felt as though the fractured pieces of my being had at last discovered wholeness and completion in your embrace.</p>

                 <p>I thought you might find my obsession with plushies a bit unusual, but even if you did, I understood—it's just that, deep inside my heart, I'm a small girl at heart. The moment we bought our first plush child, I was overwhelmed with happiness. It felt like you somehow healed my inner child. You also got me a shark, my favorite animal—the most misunderstood creatures in the world. I feel like I'm one of those sharks, always misunderstood and viewed as a threat. Yet, you are the only person who truly understands me—my present, my past, and who I will become. Thank you, my love, for giving me the best gift ever, our plush son! I will cherish him forever, raise him with love, and keep him close until the day we can live together and share warm hugs. Thank you for healing my inner child, and thank you for giving me my favorite little one </p>
